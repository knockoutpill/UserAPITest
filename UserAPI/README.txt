- Email and phone message functionality is mocked
- It is assumed that the password will some day be relevant and is therefore hashed. Also a function was added to handle an eventual login function
- A lot more testing and documentation could have been done, but this is more of a proof of concept project
- An in memory database is used for simplicity
- No performance or concurrency issues were considered
